# ToDoApp-React

This is my vision of a to-do-list. You can use it daily to manage your tasks. When you open it, you will see the form, where you can add your tasks, it's situated to the left. On the right you can see two blocks, which are responsible for result. For instance, if you complete your task, you should click green button, and then it'll be moved to the block with completed tasks, if you fail your task, then you should click red button to move it to the block of failed tasks. This way you can see how successful you are. Hope, you will find it useful)
